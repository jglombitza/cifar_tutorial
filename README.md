# CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset.
They were collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
see http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

Contains 6 files, each with 10000 shuffled images of 10 labeled classes.

The images are of size 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).
The intensity in each channels is encoded as unsigned 8-bit integers 0...255.

> The files are pickles (python2) with keys ```['data', 'labels', 'batch_label', 'filenames']```
