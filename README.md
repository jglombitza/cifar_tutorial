# CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset.
They were collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
see http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

The images are of size 32x32 pixels with 3 color channels (RGB).
The intensity in each channels is encoded as unsigned 8-bit integers 0...255.

## Start Neural Networks training:
- Fully Connected Neural Network (simple neural network + with regularization)
- Convolutional Neural Network (few convolutional layers + fully connected layers)

### Fully-connected network
Train a **fully-connected network** to reconstruct the energy of a cosmic-ray-induced air shower.
